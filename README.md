# UTAGL_SupervisedLearningClassification
Supervised Learning Classification focuses on leveraging data to build ML Classification models which predict classification labels for unseen data.  Focus of this repository is logistic regression and decision trees. 



## Model Performance and Takeaways 
Decision Tree Best Model 2, fit to data set with ccp alpha .01 has a recall on test data of .099 and on train data of .99. Assuming that All Life bank wants loan purchasers to also have a high rate of repayment, use of the recall metric is the best metric to judge madel performance. This indicates that, not only is best_model2, a Decision tree model, is the best model decision tree model, it si also the best of the two options in this project: Logistic Regression and Decision Tree as it gives the highest recall score of all models.

Key takeaways for marketing team
The key variables that have a strong relatiosnhip to the dependent variable follow: Income_scale 0.636685 Education_2 0.103283 Family_3 0.082412 Family_4 0.079906 CCAvg_log 0.056525 Education_3 0.041189

The segment of customers that should be targeted follow: Higher Income individuals (greater than approximately $150,000/year with Degrees (preferable graduate degrees) and families (married and possibly with children). Individuals should have credit card balances.
